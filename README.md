# nldl-multimodal-tutorial
Practical component of NLDL tutorial on multimodal learning

This repository contains notebooks and example code for a hands-on multimodal learning tutorial (working with text, images, and audio) using PyTorch and transformer models. The material is under construction — more notebooks, examples, and instructions will be added soon.
